# Ghana Adventures: Data-Driven Business Intelligence Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involved a comprehensive business intelligence analysis for **Ghana Adventures**, a travel and tour company based in Tamale, Ghana. The goal was to leverage internal data on bookings, revenue, and customer behavior to uncover actionable insights that would drive strategic decision-making, optimize tour offerings, and increase customer retention.

## Business Task
To analyze seasonal booking trends, tour package performance, and customer loyalty to provide data-backed recommendations for:
- Boosting revenue during off-peak seasons
- Optimizing the tour package portfolio
- Improving customer retention and repeat bookings

## Data Sources & Tools
- **Data Sources:** Proprietary booking, customer, and revenue data from Ghana Adventures
- **Data Cleaning & Processing:** Microsoft Excel
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint
- **Presentation:** Microsoft PowerPoint

## Methodology
1.  **Data Processing:** As a team, we cleaned and prepared the raw booking data for analysis, ensuring consistency in dates, customer IDs, and revenue figures
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We collaboratively analyzed the data to identify key trends in:
    - **Seasonality:** Booking and revenue fluctuations across months
    - **Product Performance:** Revenue contribution of individual tour packages
    - **Customer Behavior:** Repeat customer rates and booking type preferences (Group, Private, Individual)
    - **Geographic Distribution:** Concentration of bookings by region
3.  **Insight Generation & Synthesis:** We held regular team sync-ups to debate findings, synthesize quantitative results into strategic business insights, and align on the narrative
4.  **Visualization & Reporting:** The final presentation and dashboards were a collaborative effort, with team members responsible for different sections, followed by a peer-review process to ensure clarity and consistency

## Team
This project was completed as a collaborative team effort by:
- **Bernard Akumani (https://github.com/mr-akumani)**
- **Angela Serwaa Adu**
- **Andy Mawutornam Klutse**

Our collaborative workflow involved:
- **Dividing analytical tasks** based on individual strengths
- **Holding regular meetings** to share progress, challenges, and insights
- **Peer-reviewing all analyses and visualizations** to ensure accuracy and coherence
- **Co-developing the final presentation and recommendations**, combining our individual findings into a unified business story

## Key Insights
- **Peak Season Identification:** January emerged as the highest-volume month with 29 customers, though revenue conversion was low, indicating a budget-conscious traveler segment
- **Tour Portfolio Imbalance:** The "Safari Experience" was the top revenue generator (GHS ~5,000), while several other tours (e.g., "Valentine's Gateway") were significantly underperforming
- **Customer Retention Challenge:** Repeat customers make up only **45.68%** of the customer base, indicating a significant retention gap that requires immediate attention
- **Geographic Concentration:** Over 50% of bookings originated from the Greater Accra region, highlighting a dependency risk and an opportunity for regional expansion

## Strategic Recommendations
1.  **Tour Portfolio Optimization:** Reallocate marketing resources to top-performing tours and bundle or revamp underperformers
2.  **Targeted Geographic Expansion:** Develop tailored marketing campaigns for underserved regions like Ashanti and Volta to diversify the customer base
3.  **Customer Loyalty Acceleration:** Implement a structured loyalty and referral program to convert 54.32% of one-time customers into repeat visitors
